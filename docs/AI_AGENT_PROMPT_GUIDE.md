#### Video Color Grading Blueprint
```javascript
prompt: `Design cinematic color grading workflow for this footage:

STEP 1: TECHNICAL CORRECTION (Primary Grading)
Scene-by-scene analysis and correction:

Scene 1 [00:00-00:15]:
- Issue: Overexposed highlights, cool color cast
- Correction:
  * Lift: -5 (darken shadows slightly)
  * Gamma: 0.95 (reduce midtones)
  * Gain: 0.85 (recover highlights)
  * Temperature: +300K (warm correction)
  * Tint: +2 (slight magenta to counter green cast)

Scene 2 [00:15-00:30]:
- Issue: Underexposed, flat contrast
- Correction:
  * Lift: +8 (lift shadows)
  * Gamma: 1.1 (brighten midtones)
  * Gain: 1.05 (slight highlight boost)
  * Contrast: +15 (add punch)
  * Saturation: +10 (restore color)

[Continue for all scenes...]

STEP 2: SECONDARY COLOR CORRECTION
Targeted adjustments:

A. Skin Tones:
   - Isolate using HSL qualifier (Hue: 0-40¬∞, Sat: 15-50%)
   - Soften qualifier edges (Blur: 15px)
   - Adjustments:
     * Reduce redness: -5 saturation
     * Add warmth: +2 to orange channel
     * Maintain consistency across shots

B. Sky/Background:
   - Isolate blue channel (Hue: 200-240¬∞)
   - Adjustments:
     * Increase saturation: +15
     * Deepen blue: -5 luminance
     * Add cyan shift for clean look

C. Foliage (if applicable):
   - Isolate greens (Hue: 80-140¬∞)
   - Natural enhancement:
     * Saturation: +8
     * Shift toward teal: -5¬∞ hue
     * Add depth: -3 luminance

STEP 3: CREATIVE GRADING (Look Development)
Apply consistent cinematic look:

A. Film Emulation:
   - Add subtle film grain:
     * Size: 2.5
     * Amount: 8-12%
     * Highlights/Shadows balance: 60/40
   
B. Vignette:
   - Subtle edge darkening
   - Feather: 60%
   - Amount: -0.3 (subtle)
   - Midpoint: 0.6

C. Color Palette:
   - Shadows: Slight blue tint (Lift toward blue, Amount: 5%)
   - Highlights: Warm orange tint (Gain toward orange, Amount: 3%)
   - Creates orange/teal cinematic look

D. Contrast Curve:
   - Gentle S-curve for depth
   - Protect shadows from crushing
   - Soft highlight roll-off

STEP 4: MATCHING & CONSISTENCY
Shot-by-shot matching:

- Create reference still from "hero" shot
- Match each shot:
  * Check skin tones (use vectorscope)
  * Verify highlight levels (waveform)
  * Ensure consistent saturation (parade)
- Use comparison wipe to verify matches
- Save grade as preset for similar shots

STEP 5: FINAL POLISH

A. Sharpening:
   - Luma sharpen: Amount 15%, Radius 1.0
   - Apply to final graded image
   - Avoid over-sharpening faces

B. Noise Reduction:
   - Temporal NR: Medium (preserves detail)
   - Spatial NR: Low (only if necessary)
   - Check at 100% zoom

C. Output Settings:
   - Codec: H.264 (web) / ProRes 422 HQ (archive)
   - Resolution: 4K (3840x2160) maintain source
   - Frame Rate: Match source (23.976, 24, 30, 60)
   - Bitrate: 40 Mbps (4K), 20 Mbps (1080p)
   - Color Space: Rec.709 for web delivery

QUALITY CONTROL CHECKLIST:
‚ñ° Consistent skin tones across all shots
‚ñ° No clipped highlights or crushed blacks
‚ñ° Smooth gradients (no banding)
‚ñ° Match scene-to-scene exposure
‚ñ° Color consistency in continuous scenes
‚ñ° Appropriate contrast for delivery platform
‚ñ° Test on reference monitor (calibrated)
‚ñ° View in intended playback environment

Software: DaVinci Resolve 18+ (recommended)
Alternative: Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro X
Estimated Time: 2-4 hours for 5-minute video
Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced

NOTES:
- Always work in log color space if footage was shot in log
- Create version backups before major changes
- Use scopes (waveform, vectorscope, histogram) constantly
- Reference professional work in similar style
- Less is often more - avoid over-grading`

## üìä Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ‚ùå Vague Prompts
**Bad**: "Make this image better"
**Good**: "Analyze image quality focusing on sharpness, exposure, and white balance. Provide specific adjustment values to correct any issues."

### ‚ùå Ambiguous Requests
**Bad**: "What's wrong with this video?"
**Good**: "Identify technical issues in this video including exposure inconsistencies, audio sync problems, color grading variations between scenes, and shaky footage. Provide timestamps for each issue."

### ‚ùå Missing Context
**Bad**: "Create editing instructions"
**Good**: "Create portrait retouching instructions for LinkedIn profile photo. Target audience: corporate executives. Style: professional but approachable. Output: suitable for 400x400px display."

### ‚ùå Unrealistic Expectations
**Bad**: "Transform this low-quality phone photo into magazine cover quality"
**Good**: "Analyze this photo and suggest realistic improvements within quality constraints. Identify which issues can be corrected (color, contrast) vs. which cannot (resolution, fundamental sharpness)."
