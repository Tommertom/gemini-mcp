## 🎨 Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### For Image Generation
```
[Subject] + [Style] + [Composition] + [Lighting] + [Colors] + [Mood] + [Technical Specs]
```

Example:
```
"Three diverse business professionals (Asian woman, Black man, Hispanic woman) 
sitting around modern conference table, engaged in collaborative discussion, 
photorealistic style inspired by Annie Leibovitz, medium shot from slightly 
above eye level, natural window light from camera left, warm color palette 
with teal accents, professional yet approachable atmosphere, 4K resolution 16:9"
```

### For Image Analysis
```
[Analysis Type] + [Specific Elements] + [Output Format] + [Detail Level]
```

Example:
```
"Analyze composition: Rule of thirds alignment, leading lines, balance, 
framing, negative space, focal point, depth layers. Provide ratings (1-10) 
for each element with specific improvement recommendations ranked by impact. 
Output as numbered list."
```

### For Editing Instructions
```
[Workflow Type] + [Media Type] + [End Use] + [Detailed Steps] + [Quality Checks] + [Export Settings]
```

Example:
```
"Create professional retouching workflow for corporate headshot targeting 
LinkedIn profile. Step-by-step instructions including: frequency separation 
skin retouching, eye enhancement, teeth whitening, background blur, color 
grading for warm natural look. Include specific parameter values, quality 
control checks, and export settings for 400x400px web use."
